Cracking the Market Code with AI-Driven Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Analysis
Overview
This project aims to predict future stock prices using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and time series analysis. Leveraging deep learning models, particularly LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), the system forecasts stock prices based on historical data. A Flask-based web API is included to provide real-time predictions.

Objectives
Apply machine learning and time series techniques to financial data.
Build and train a deep learning model to predict future stock prices.
Develop a simple API for end-user interaction.
Test model accuracy using real-world stock data.
Technologies Used
Python
Flask (for API)
TensorFlow / Keras (for LSTM model)
yFinance (for data collection)
NumPy, Pandas (for data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (for preprocessing)
